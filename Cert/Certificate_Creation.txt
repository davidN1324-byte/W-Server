# Linux 

# Install pakage
$ apt install openssl

# Self-signed certificate generation (certificate + key)
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out cert.pem

Explanation of parameters:
-newkey rsa:4096 — creates a new 4096-bit RSA key.
-nodes — does not encrypt the private key (no password required when starting the server).
-keyout key.pem — path to save the private key.
-x509 — generates a self-signed certificate.
-days 365 — certificate validity period (can be changed).
-out cert.pem — path to save the certificate.

# Certificate verification
$ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout

# Windows

# Download OpenSSL for Windows. Install it and add it to PATH if needed.
# Certificate generation open cmd or PowerShell
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out cert.pem

# Certificate verification
$ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout

!!! If the certificate is needed for public use, it is better to use Let's Encrypt instead of a self-signed one. !!!
